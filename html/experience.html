        <h1>My Experience in the CS Field</h1>
          <div class="container2">
              <p>My interest "for computer science" or rather, games, began when i was a kid, my family owned a game arcade and i'd play often,
                now more ofter than not.</p>
              <p>During my early teens i often wondered, and begged to ask "How exactly do these things work", "what are the mechanics behind it?"</p>
              <p>Boy was i in for it.</p>
              <p>The systems are intricate, but as challenging as the mechanics are for video games or other complete programs
                 i've resolved to try my best, more or less, so i can design similiar apps and thus i joined the University's student body.</p>
              <p>And now here at the university in my late teens i'm exposed to a myriad of different routes i can take in Computer Science.</p>
              <p>Crytopgraphy, Data Analyst, Software Engineering, Networking, A.I and a bunch more.</p>
              <p>So far, the exprience has been fun.</p>
